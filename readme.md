Conceptual Modeling of the Semantic Web
===================


Motivation: This project aims to create a structured ontology of classical composers, covering multiple musical periods from the medieval era to the present day. The ontology provides a comprehensive representation of composers, emphasizing their influences, distinctive styles, and the historical-cultural context in which they worked.

Key Features:

Periodization of Musical Styles: It categorizes the evolution of musical forms over time, helping users explore how innovations in one style impacted later developments.
Classification by Musical Theme: This feature allows users to explore a variety of works, ranging from sacred compositions to symphonies, presenting an overview of each composerâ€™s contribution across different music genres.
Genre and Cultural Influence: Composers are classified by genre, and the system highlights the cultural influences that shaped their music, offering insights into the social and geographic factors that contributed to their work.
Goals:

Provide a structured, standardized representation of classical music composers and their works.
Offer a flexible resource for music lovers, students, and scholars, enhancing understanding of the history of composers and their contributions.
Use Cases:

Academic Research: Scholars can conduct research, analyze historical trends, and explore the relationships between composers and their works.
Music Enthusiasts: Classical music fans can deepen their understanding of favorite composers and explore new works.
Data Management: The ontology is designed for integration with data management systems to maintain and update composer-related information in a structured way.
Technical Overview:

Aligned with external ontologies like "Schema" and "FOAF" to ensure interoperability with other systems.
Developed using tools like Widoco for documentation and WebVowl for visualization.
Conclusion: This ontology offers a valuable resource for studying classical music, providing clear, consistent, and interoperable data that supports tasks such as consultation, reference, and verification for both researchers and enthusiasts.
